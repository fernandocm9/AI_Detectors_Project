# AI_Detectors_Project
This project is on the topic of AI Detectors in Education. The main goal is to assessing the efficacy of AI detectors in identifying AI-Generated code in the education system.
This tool is to help educators have an idea of whether their students are participating in programming related classes or if they are just feeding prompts into the various AI engines and replicating that as their solution.
We are going to be focusing on 5 Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code based on a common prompt. We will then write human-generated code to match these prompts and run both sets of code through AI code detectors to see if these detectors can efficiently categorize code as human-generated or AI-generated.

LLMs Used: ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude and Perplexity AI
AI Generated Code Detectors: GPTZero, Sapling, GPT-2 Detector, DetectGPT and Giant Language Model Test Room.
